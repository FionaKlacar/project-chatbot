# Project Name

I made a chatbot with a conversation between a bot and a user based on ideas for toddler activities. 

## The problem

I approached the problem through studying an example chatbot and generating ideas for my own. I then planned the different questions and answers I wanted to have.  I used Javascript. If I had more time I would try to use better techniques to get my code to run the way I want it to.
